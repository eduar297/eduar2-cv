Since Git came into my life, I manage all the versions of my projects with this wonderful tool. I have learned how to deploy servers in the cloud efficiently, as well as various tools to do it. I am from the group of obscure programmers who use any Linux distro. I have a medium-advanced level of Bash; and almost everything I have learned has been self-taught, with the help of man's best friend, the Internet."
